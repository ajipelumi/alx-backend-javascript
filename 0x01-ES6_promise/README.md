## ES6 Promise

This repository contains the code and resources for learning about promises in ES6.

**Promises** are a new way to handle asynchronous operations in JavaScript. They are easy to use when making asynchronous requests to a server, handling the response, and performing additional operations on the data.

### Topics Covered
- **Promises**: We learn about promises, a new feature in ES6, and how they can be used to handle asynchronous operations in JavaScript. We also learn about the `fetch()` method, a new feature in ES6, and how it can be used to make asynchronous requests to a server.

- **Promise States**: We learn about the three states of a promise, and how they can be used to determine the status of an asynchronous operation. Each state is represented by a different value: `pending`, `fulfilled`, or `rejected`.

- **Promise Methods**: We learn about the methods available on a promise, and how they can be used to handle the result of an asynchronous operation. These methods include `then()`, `catch()`, and `finally()`.

- **Promise Chaining**: We learn about promise chaining, and how it can be used to perform multiple asynchronous operations in sequence.

- **Promise Error Handling**: We learn about promise error handling, and how it can be used to handle errors in asynchronous operations. We also learn about the `throw` keyword, and how it can be used to throw an error in JavaScript.

- **Async/Await**: We learn about async/await, a new feature in ES6, and how it can be used to handle asynchronous operations in JavaScript.

### Code Snippets
The following code snippet demonstrates how to create a promise in JavaScript:
```javascript
const promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  // Perform an asynchronous operation
  // ...
  if (/* operation successful */) {
    resolve('Operation successful');
  } else {
    reject('Operation failed');
  }
});
```
