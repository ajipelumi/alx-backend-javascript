## ES6 Classes

This repository contains the code and resources for learning about classes in ES6.

**Classes** are a way to create objects and deal with inheritance in JavaScript. They are easy to use when creating objects and dealing with inheritance.

### Topics Covered

- **Classes**: We learn about classes, a new feature in ES6, and how they can be used to create objects in JavaScript. We also learn about the `constructor()` method, a new feature in ES6, and how it can be used to initialize objects.

- **Class Inheritance**: We learn about class inheritance, and how it can be used to create a class that inherits from another class. We also learn about the `super()` method, a new feature in ES6, and how it can be used to call the constructor of the parent class.

- **Class Methods**: We learn about class methods, and how they can be used to add functionality to a class. We also learn about the `static` keyword, a new feature in ES6, and how it can be used to create static methods on a class.

- **Getters and Setters**: We learn about getters and setters, and how they can be used to get and set the values of properties on an object. We also learn about the `get` and `set` keywords, a new feature in ES6, and how they can be used to create getters and setters on a class.

### Code Snippets

The following code snippet demonstrates how to create a class in JavaScript:

```javascript
class Person {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }
}
```

The following code snippet demonstrates how to create a class that inherits from another class:

```javascript
class Person {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }
}

class Student extends Person {
  constructor(name, grade) {
    super(name);
    this.grade = grade;
  }
}
```

The following code snippet demonstrates how to create a class method in JavaScript:
```javascript

class Person {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }

  sayHello() {
    console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name}`);
  }
}
```

The following code snippet demonstrates how to create a static method in JavaScript:
```javascript
class Person {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }

  static create(name) {
    return new Person(name);
  }
}
```

The following code snippet demonstrates how to create a getter and setter in JavaScript:
```javascript
class Person {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }

  get name() {
    return this._name;
  }

  set name(name) {
    this._name = name;
  }
}
```
