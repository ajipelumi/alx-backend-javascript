## JavaScript

This repository contains the codebase for the ALX Backend JavaScript project.
The project is designed to provide a foundation for building backend applications using JavaScript.

**JavaScript** is a popular programming language that is widely used for building dynamic and interactive web applications.
It is primarily executed on the client-side in web browsers, but it can also be used on the server-side with the help of frameworks like Node.js.

JavaScript provides the following features and capabilities:
- **Scripting Language**: JavaScript is a lightweight scripting language that can be embedded into HTML pages.
  It allows us to write code that can be executed directly in a web browser without the need for compilation.

- **Client-side Interactivity**: JavaScript enables interactive and dynamic behavior in web pages.
  We can use it to manipulate the HTML structure, handle events like button clicks or form submissions, and update the page content in response to user actions.

- **Data Manipulation**: JavaScript provides built-in objects and functions for manipulating and processing data.
  We can work with strings, numbers, arrays, objects, and perform operations like concatenation, mathematical calculations, sorting, filtering, and more.

- **DOM Manipulation**: The Document Object Model (DOM) represents the structure of an HTML page.
  JavaScript allows us to access and modify the DOM elements, their attributes, and styles.
  This enables us to create interactive experiences by dynamically updating the content and appearance of web pages.

- **Asynchronous Programming**: JavaScript supports asynchronous programming using features like callbacks, promises, and async/await.
  This allows us to perform tasks such as making network requests, handling file operations, or executing time-consuming operations without blocking the execution of other code.

- **Cross-platform Compatibility**: JavaScript runs on various platforms, including different web browsers, operating systems, and devices. This makes it a versatile language for developing web applications that can reach a wide audience.
