## ES6 Basics

This repository contains the code and resources for learning the basics of ECMAScript 6 (ES6), also known as ECMAScript 2015.

**ES6** is a major update to the JavaScript language, introducing new syntax, features, and improvements to make JavaScript development more powerful and efficient.

### Topics Covered
- **Let and Const**: We learn about the let and const keywords for declaring variables, their differences compared to var, and how they handle variable scope.

- **Template Literals**: We learn about template literals, a new way to create strings in ES6, and how they can be used to create multi-line strings and perform string interpolation.

- **Arrow Functions**: We learn about arrow functions, a new way to create functions in ES6, and how they can be used to write more concise and expressive code compared to traditional functions.

- **Default Parameters**: We learn about default parameters, a new feature in ES6, and how they can be used to assign default values to function parameters.

- **Rest and Spread**: We learn about rest and spread operators, new features in ES6, and how they can be used to write more flexible functions and simplify array manipulation.

- **Destructuring**: We learn about destructuring, a new feature in ES6, and how it can be used to extract values from arrays and objects into distinct variables.

- **Classes**: We learn about classes, a new feature in ES6, and how they can be used to create objects with shared methods and properties.

- **Modules**: We learn about modules, a new feature in ES6, and how they can be used to organize code into multiple files and import/export functionality between them.

- **Promises**: We learn about promises, a new feature in ES6, and how they can be used to handle asynchronous operations in JavaScript.

- **Generators**: We learn about generators, a new feature in ES6, and how they can be used to create iterators for asynchronous operations in JavaScript.
